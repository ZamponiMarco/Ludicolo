This is the repository of the project proposed by **Stelluti Francesco Pio** and **Zamponi Marco** for the **Logic and Constraint Programming** course during the Academic Year 2020/2021.

The aim of the project is to implement a simplified version of *Pokémon* battles as seen in the game series of the same name. 

The languages and tools that have been used in order to provide this project are [**Java 11**](https://www.java.com/en/) and [**Drools**](https://www.drools.org/)

## Requirements and start-up

The requirement to start the project is [**Maven**](https://maven.apache.org/).

The Maven command that starts the game and the associated GUI has to be executed in the project root folder and is the following:
```
mvn javafx:run
```

## Presentation

The folder
